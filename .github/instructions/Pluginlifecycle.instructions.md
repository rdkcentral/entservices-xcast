### Mandatory Lifecycle Methods

Every plugin must implement:

- Initialize(IShell* service) → Called when the plugin is activated.

- Deinitialize(IShell* service) → Called when the plugin is deactivated.

### Initialization

### Requirement

- Initialize() must handle all setup logic; constructors should remain minimal.
- It must validate inputs and acquire necessary references.

### Example

```cpp
const string HdcpProfile::Initialize(PluginHost::IShell* service) {
    .....
    if (_hdcpProfile != nullptr) {
        ...
        Exchange::IConfiguration* configure = _hdcpProfile->QueryInterface<Exchange::IConfiguration>();
        ...
    }
    ....
}
```

- The plugin should register its listener object twice:

  - Framework Service (_service): Use _service->Register(listener) to receive general plugin state change notifications (like ACTIVATED/DEACTIVATED).

    Example: _service->Register(&_hdcpProfileNotification);

  - Target Plugin Interface (_hdcpProfile): Use _hdcpProfile->Register(listener) to receive the plugin's specific custom events (e.g., onProfileChanged).This registration serves as the internal bridge that captures C++ events from the implementation, allowing the plugin to translate and broadcast them as JSON-RPC notifications to external subscribers.

    Example: _hdcpProfile->Register(&_hdcpProfileNotification);

- It must return a non-empty string on failure with a clear error message.

**Example:**

```cpp
const string HdcpProfile::Initialize(PluginHost::IShell* service) {
    ...
    message = _T("HdcpProfile could not be configured");
    ...
    message = _T("HdcpProfile implementation did not provide a configuration interface");
    ...
    message = _T("HdcpProfile plugin could not be initialized");
    ...
}
```

- Threads or async tasks should be started here if needed, with proper tracking.

**Example:**

```cpp
Core::hresult NativeJSImplementation::Initialize(string waylandDisplay)
{   
    std::cout << "initialize called on nativejs implementation " << std::endl;
    mRenderThread = std::thread([=](std::string waylandDisplay) {
        mNativeJSRenderer = std::make_shared<NativeJSRenderer>(waylandDisplay);
        mNativeJSRenderer->run();    
        std::cout << "After launch application execution ... " << std::endl;
        mNativeJSRenderer.reset();
    }, waylandDisplay);
    return (Core::ERROR_NONE);
}
```

- Before executing Initialize, ensure all private member variables are in a reset state (either initialized by the constructor or cleared by a prior Deinitialize). Validate this by asserting their default values.

**Example:**

```cpp
const string HdcpProfile::Initialize(PluginHost::IShell *service)
{
    ASSERT(_server == nullptr);
    ASSERT(_impl == nullptr);
    ASSERT(_connectionId == 0);
}
```

- If a plugin needs to keep the `IShell` pointer beyond the scope of `Initialize()` (for example, by storing it in a member variable to access other plugins via COM-RPC or JSON-RPC throughout the plugin's lifecycle), then it **must** call `AddRef()` on the service instance before storing it, to increment its reference count. If the plugin only uses the `service` pointer within `Initialize()` and does not store it for later use, then `AddRef()` **must not** be called on the `IShell` instance.

**Example:**

```cpp
const string HdcpProfile::Initialize(PluginHost::IShell *service)
{
    ...
    _service = service;
    _service->AddRef();
    // _service will be used to access other plugins via COM-RPC or JSON-RPC in later methods.
    ...
}
```

- Only one Initialize() method must exist — avoid overloads or split logic.

### Deinitialize and Cleanup

### Requirement

- Deinitialize() must clean up all resources acquired during Initialize(). It must release resources in reverse order of initialization.
- Every pointer or instance must be checked for nullptr before cleanup.

**Example:**

```cpp
void HdcpProfile::Deinitialize(PluginHost::IShell* service) {
    ...
    if (_service != nullptr) {
        _service->Release();
        _service = nullptr;
    }
    ...
}
```

- All acquired interfaces must be explicitly Released().

**Example:**

```cpp
void HdcpProfile::Deinitialize(PluginHost::IShell* service) {
    ...
    if (_hdcpProfile != nullptr) {
        ....
        // Release interface
        RPC::IRemoteConnection* connection = service->RemoteConnection(_connectionId);
        connection->Terminate();
        connection->Release();
        ....
    }
    ...
}
```

- Unregister your listener from both the Target Plugin interface and the Framework Shell before releasing the pointers.

**Example:**

```cpp
void HdcpProfile::Deinitialize(PluginHost::IShell* service) {
    ...
    // 1. Unregister from the Target Plugin (stops custom events)
    if (_hdcpProfile != nullptr) {
        _hdcpProfile->Unregister(&_hdcpProfileNotification);
    }
    // 2. Unregister from the Framework Shell (stops state change events)
    if (_service != nullptr) {
        _service->Unregister(&_hdcpProfileNotification);
    }
    ...
}
```

- Remote connections must be terminated after releasing plugin references.

**Example:**

```cpp
void HdcpProfile::Deinitialize(PluginHost::IShell* service) {
    ...
    if (_hdcpProfile != nullptr) {
        ....
        if (nullptr != connection) {
            // Trigger the cleanup sequence for out-of-process code,
            // which ensures that unresponsive processes are terminated
            // if they do not stop gracefully.
            connection->Terminate();
            connection->Release();
        }
        ....
    }
}
```

- Threads must be joined or safely terminated.

**Example:**

```cpp
Core::hresult NativeJSImplementation::Deinitialize() {
    LOGINFO("deinitializing NativeJS process");
    if (mNativeJSRenderer) {
        mNativeJSRenderer->terminate();
        if (mRenderThread.joinable()) {
            mRenderThread.join();
        }
    }
    return (Core::ERROR_NONE);
}
```

- Internal state (e.g., _connectionId, _service) and private members should be reset to their default state.

**Example:**

```cpp
void HdcpProfile::Deinitialize(PluginHost::IShell* service) {
    ...
    if (connection != nullptr) {
        connection->Terminate();
        connection->Release();
    }
    ...
    if (_service != nullptr) {
        _service->Release();
        _service = nullptr;
    }
}
```

- If AddRef() was called on the IShell instance in Initialize(), then it should call Release() on the IShell instance to decrement its reference count.

**Example:**

```cpp
void HdcpProfile::Deinitialize(PluginHost::IShell* service) {
    ...
    if (_service != nullptr) {
        _service->Release();
        _service = nullptr;
    }
    ...
}
```

- All cleanup steps should be logged for traceability.

**Example:**

```cpp
void HdcpProfile::Deinitialize(PluginHost::IShell* service) {
    ...
    SYSLOG(Logging::Shutdown, (_T("HdcpProfile de-initialized")));
    ...
}
```


### Deactivated

Each plugin should implement the Deactivated method. In Deactivated, it should be checked if remote connectionId matches your plugin's connectionId. If it matches your plugin's connectionId, the plugin should submit a deactivation job to handle the out-of-process failure gracefully.

### Example

```cpp
void XCast::Deactivated(RPC::IRemoteConnection *connection)
{
    if (connection->Id() == _connectionId)
    {
        ASSERT(nullptr != _service);
        Core::IWorkerPool::Instance().Submit(PluginHost::IShell::Job::Create(_service, PluginHost::IShell::DEACTIVATED, PluginHost::IShell::FAILURE));
    }
}
```
